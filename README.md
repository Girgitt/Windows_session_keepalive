# Windows session keepalive: disable automatic screen locking
A tiny taskbar-icon type of program to disable windows screen auto-locking.

Windows executable is available under release tab. Just unpack and run the exe. 


Program stays in the taskbar and displays current operation mode:

 * red lock means desktop session will be locked according to the policy / windows settings

 * green lock means every N seconds a mouse event will be sent which resets (typically) session locking timeout

Lock suspension can be enabled or disabled using a context menu available under the right mouse button. 

Program also cycles the mode with a left-button double-click.
